# Minesweeper Game in Python
Welcome to the Minesweeper Game in Python project! This project is a simple implementation of the classic Minesweeper game using Python. Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle game where the objective is to clear a minefield without detonating any mines.

## Features
1. **Grid Generation:** Generates a grid of cells representing the minefield, where each cell can be either empty or contain a mine.

2. **User Interface:** Provides a command-line interface (CLI) for users to interact with the game, revealing cells and marking potential mines.

3. **Game Mechanics:** Implements game mechanics such as revealing cells, flagging potential mines, and determining game outcomes.

4. **Customization:** Allows customization of game parameters such as grid size and mine density to adjust the difficulty level.

## Installation
To run the Minesweeper Game in Python locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/RadinaAvramova/minesweeper.git

2. **Navigate to the Directory:** Change your current directory to the location of the cloned repository:

cd minesweeper

3. **Run the Game:** Run the following command to start the Minesweeper game:

python minesweeper.py

4. **Follow On-Screen Instructions:** Once the game is running, follow the on-screen instructions to play Minesweeper.

## Usage
1. **Revealing Cells:** Use the arrow keys or input coordinates to reveal cells on the grid. Be careful not to reveal any mines!

2. **Marking Potential Mines:** Use the flagging feature to mark potential mine locations. This helps you avoid detonating mines accidentally.

3. **Game Over:** If you reveal a cell containing a mine, the game is over. You can choose to play again or exit.

4. **Victory:** Successfully reveal all non-mine cells to win the game! Celebrate your victory and challenge yourself with a higher difficulty level.

## Customization
You can customize the Minesweeper game by modifying aspects such as the grid size, mine density, and user interface. Additionally, you can add new features, implement different game modes, or enhance the user experience as desired.
